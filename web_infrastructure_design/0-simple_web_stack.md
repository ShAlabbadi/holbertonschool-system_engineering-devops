# What is a server?
A server is a dedicated computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers (called clients) over a network. In this infrastructure, it's a single physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web application stack - including the web server, application server, application code, and database.

# What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name foobar.com serves as a human-readable address that maps to the server's numerical IP address (8.8.8.8). It functions like a contact name in your phonebook - instead of memorizing the technical IP address, users can remember the simple domain name to access the website.

# What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
The www in www.foobar.com is configured using an A Record (Address Record). An A record is a DNS record that directly maps a hostname to an IPv4 address. In this case, the www A record points to the server IP 8.8.8.8.

# What is the role of the web server?
The web server has three primary roles:
1. Static Content Handler - Serves static files directly (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
2. Reverse Proxy - Receives incoming HTTP requests and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server
3. Request Router - Manages and directs incoming traffic to the appropriate backend services

# What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes the business logic of your web application. It:
- Processes dynamic content generation
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Manages application workflow and business rules
- Processes form submissions and user interactions
- Communicates with the database to retrieve or store data

# What is the role of the database?
The database (MySQL) serves as the persistent data storage layer that:
- Stores all application data (user accounts, content, transactions)
- Provides structured data organization and relationships
- Ensures data integrity and security
- Enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation through SQL queries

# What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the?
The server communicates using the TCP/IP protocol suite over the internet. Specifically:
1. HTTP/HTTPS protocols for web traffic (application layer)
2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, ordered data delivery
3. IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing and routing packets between networks
